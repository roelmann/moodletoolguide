# moodletoolguide
Web version of @catspyjamas well known Moodle ToolGuide

This has been created as a step towards creating a similar tool guide
for our wider VLE at University of South Wales - incorporating other
tools such as web-conferencing etc.

It was created from the original moodle toolguide and the moodle 2
version adapted by Gavin Henrick and is released with the same Creative
Commons, with attribution, non-commercial, share-alike licence as the
originals.

Version2
Also includes the Tool Selector - a decision tree tool to choose an
appropriate tool based on work done by Alison Ruth
